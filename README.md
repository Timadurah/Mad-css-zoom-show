## Authentication

Most reported data breaches are caused by the use of weak, default or stolen passwords (according to [this Verizon report](http://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_dbir-2016-executive-summary_xg_en.pdf)).

Use long, strong and unique passwords, manage them in a secure password manager, enable 2-factor authentication, keep on top of breaches and take care while logging into your accounts.

**Security** | **Priority** | **Details and Hints**
--- | --- | ---
**Use a Strong Password** | Recommended | If your password is too short, or contains dictionary words, places or names- then it can be easily cracked through brute force, or guessed by someone. The easiest way to make a strong password, is by making it long (12+ characters)- consider using a 'passphrase', made up of many words.
